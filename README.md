## üîç Key Insights

### ASTRA Strengths
‚úÖ Better at Equipment detection (97.83% accuracy)
‚úÖ Better at Co-Manufacturing classification (88.09% accuracy)
‚úÖ Fewer false positives in most categories
‚úÖ Higher precision overall

### ASTRA Weaknesses
‚ùå Poor Specialty classification (63.90% accuracy)
‚ùå Some false negatives in Food & Beverage category

### QWEN Strengths
‚úÖ Perfect Food & Beverage classification (100% accuracy)
‚úÖ Significantly better Specialty classification (80.51% accuracy)
‚úÖ Higher overall accuracy (90.97%)
‚úÖ More balanced performance across categories

### QWEN Weaknesses
‚ùå Slightly more false negatives in Equipment detection (11 vs 6)
‚ùå Marginally lower precision in Co-Manufacturing

## üìà Metrics Explained

### Accuracy
Percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions.
- **Formula:** (TP + TN) / Total

### Precision
Percentage of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
- **Formula:** TP / (TP + FP)

### False Positives (FP)
Model predicted positive, but ground truth is negative.
- **Impact:** Over-classification

### False Negatives (FN)
Model predicted negative, but ground truth is positive.
- **Impact:** Under-classification/missed cases

## üéØ Recommendations

1. **Ensemble Approach**: Combine both models for optimal results
   - Use QWEN for Specialty and Food & Beverage
   - Use ASTRA for Equipment and Co-Manufacturing

2. **Production Strategy**: Implement category-specific routing
   ```python
   def classify(data, category):
       if category in ['Specialty', 'Food & Beverage']:
           return qwen_model.predict(data)
       else:
           return astra_model.predict(data)
   ```

3. **Improvement Focus**:
   - Enhance ASTRA's Specialty classification (biggest gap)
   - Reduce QWEN's false negatives in Equipment detection
   - Investigate the 100 specialty errors made by ASTRA

4. **Validation**: Focus human review on:
   - Cases where models disagree
   - Specialty classifications (lowest accuracy)
   - False positives in Co-Manufacturing
